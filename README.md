# 🛍️ E-Commerce Product Listing Page

This project is a **frontend assignment** built with **React + Vite** that recreates a pixel-perfect, responsive product listing screen based on the provided Figma design.  
It demonstrates **clean reusable components**, **filters, sorting, and pagination**, and ensures accessibility and responsiveness across devices.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Recreate the product listing screen from the Figma with:

- Pixel-accurate UI
- Clean, reusable components
- Fully working filters, sort, and pagination
- Responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile

---

## ✨ Features & Scope

### 🔹 Reusable Components

- `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `FilterPanel`, `ProductCard`, `Badge`, `Rating`, `Pagination`, `Footer`
- Configurable via props and styled to match design

### 🔹 Sidebar Filters (expand/collapse)

- Categories expand/collapse intuitively
- At least 6 items shown (placeholders or “View more” pattern if fewer)

### 🔹 Product Listing Grid

- Grid layout matches Figma breakpoints and spacing
- Each product card includes:
  - Product image (placeholder if needed)
  - HOT badge
  - Title
  - Original price, discount price, discount percent
  - Rating (stars + count)
  - Quick actions (wishlist/compare if applicable)

### 🔹 Color Selection

- Color swatches (chips) to filter products
- Selected color highlights product cards with a visible background update

### 🔹 Sorting & Pagination

- Sort by Name, Price, Popularity (asc/desc)
- Client-side pagination with active page highlighting
- State sync with URL query params (optional)

### 🔹 Responsiveness

- Desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts tested at `320px`, `768px`, `1024px`
- Sidebar collapses into a drawer on smaller screens

### 🔹 Footer

- Implemented exactly as in Figma (links, layout, spacing)
